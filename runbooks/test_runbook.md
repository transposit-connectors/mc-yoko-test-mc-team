The top first-level heading becomes the runbook title. A paragraph immediately following the title is the runbook description.

## Step 1

Check most recent logs and commits:

[Query Stackdriver Logs](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/yoko-test-mc-team/actions/query_stackdriver_logs)

[List Recent Commits](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/yoko-test-mc-team/actions/list_recent_commits)

[List Deployments](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/yoko-test-mc-team/actions/list_deployments)

[Deploy App](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/yoko-test-mc-team/actions/deploy_app)

## Step 2

Please create a task on Height to track the issue you ran into
[Create Height Ticket](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/yoko-test-mc-team/actions/create_height_ticket)

## Step 3

And that's how runbooks are made. Happy runbooking!
