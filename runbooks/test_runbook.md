The top first-level heading becomes the runbook title. A paragraph immediately following the title is the runbook description.

## Step 1

Runbook steps are defined by second-level headings. Text following a second-level heading, like this, describes and contains information about a runbook step.

Click on **Add action** above to insert a URL pointing to an action. These are just Markdown links, but are rendered as buttons inside Slack, and when clicked, will run the action.

You can use `Markdown` *formatting* and [the usual syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), but be aware some formatting and some Markdown features, including tables, images, and inline HTML, won't be displayed when viewing a runbook inside Slack.

## Step 2

Each second-level heading defines a separate step. The runbook's table of contents is made up of each of the runbook's steps.

### Third-level headings like this are treated as headings only

To divide information within a step, you can use a third-level heading.

## Step 3

And that's how runbooks are made. Happy runbooking!
